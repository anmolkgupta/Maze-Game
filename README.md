# Tilting_Maze_Game

The "Rat in a Maze" problem is a classic example of a maze-solving puzzle.

Applying the same concept the goal of the puzzle is to find a path for the KEY from the starting point to the destination of its HOUSE, while avoiding obstacles within the maze.

This project is a JavaScript-based implementation of the Rat in a Maze problem using the RECURSION and BACKTRACKING algorithm. The solution is visualized on a website using JavaScript and CSS.

## How to play

* Either the arrow keys or WASD tilt the board.
* Maneuver the ball to the fancy green circle emitting particles to win
* Hit 'E' or 'H' to change modes of the game
* Hit 'Spacebar' to restart the game
* A maximum tilt of 20 degrees is allowed
```
